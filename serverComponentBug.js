In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory structure with server components and incorrect data fetching.  If you attempt to fetch data within a server component using `async/await` without proper error handling, and that fetch fails (e.g., network issue, server error), the error might not be caught effectively and might cause a silent failure or unexpected behavior.  The component might render without the expected data or may result in a seemingly blank page with no obvious error messages in the browser's console.
